# deckard
A jQuery plug-in that allows a view to be treated as a card in a deck

---

Wraps an entire view as an independent front-end container, allowing multiple cards to be present on the same screen independently, using ajax to update from the backend.

**Note**
It makes use of a utilities class not yet supplied.
